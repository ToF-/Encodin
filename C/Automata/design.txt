c = incoming char
l = last char read
ptr = char * beginning of sequence
n = size of sequence
t = type of sequence E=enclosing R=runlength

examples :
 A
  c  l  ptr  n  t
  A  _  000  1  E
  \n A  000  1  E
\n means end of line 
output enclosing from 000 for 1 (A) = 1A1

 AA
  c  l  ptr  n  t
  A  _  000  1  E
  A  A  000  2  R
equal char means we have a runlength
  \n A  000  2  R
diff char means we have to print what we have
output runlength 2 of 000 for 2 (AA) = AA

 AAB
  c  l  ptr  n  t
  A  _  000  1  E
  A  A  000  2  R
equal char means we have a runlength
  B  A  
diff char means we have to print what we have
output runlength 2 of 000 for 2 (AA) = AA
        002 1  E
a new sequence is starting at 002, it's enclosing a priori
  \n B  002 1  E
\n means end of line
output enclosing from 002 for 1 (B) = 1B1

ABB
  c  l  ptr  n  t
  A  _  000  1  E
  B  A  000  2  E
  B  B
equal char means we have a runlenght when we thought we had enclosing
output enclosing from 000 for (2-1) = 1A1
        001  2  R
 \n  B  
\n means end of line
output runlength 2 of 001 for 2 (BB)


    c = *srce
    if c == \n
        break
    else if c == l
        n++
        t = RL
